# TrainDriver
A simple Cinema 4D plugin that lets you chain up wagons and drive them on tracks. This is great for trains, roller coasters, basically anything that moves on tracks/rails.


## API
This plugin demonstrates the following C4D API aspects:

* Expression tag plugins, derived from `class TagData`
* Working with `class SplineObject` and `class SplineLengthData`
* Aligning matrices to splines and spline tangents
* Text output in the attribute manager
